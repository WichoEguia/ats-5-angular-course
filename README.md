## Learnings, reflections and conclusions
background, this project allowed me to delve into the intricacies of building responsive and interactive UIs, as well as understand the frontend team’s typical challenges. By engaging with components, services, and Angular-specific modules, I’ve improved my ability to navigate and adapt to frontend requirements and refine skills in TypeScript and Angular's modular structure.

One of the biggest insights for me was recognizing the need for synergy between frontend and backend development to optimize performance and user experience. Concepts like reactive programming and component-driven architecture in Angular directly link to efficient data management from the backend, providing a more seamless and effective flow of data to the UI. I realized how backend data handling must align with frontend expectations, which also improves API design and ensures smooth data transitions, minimizing delays or inconsistencies in the user interface.

Reflecting on this experience, I see how working on the frontend has broadened my perspective on the full development lifecycle. This firsthand involvement with Angular has improved my skills in debugging, routing, and handling real-time data in a way that respects both user experience and performance. Going forward, I feel more prepared to collaborate closely with frontend teams, appreciate their workflows, and apply my learnings to make backend processes more responsive and adaptable.
